# software-updates-bot
:construction_worker: A bot that looks for popular software (and software-related stuff) updates, then push data to this repository. See:  
* [JSON report](report/report.json)
* [Markdown report](report/report.md)
* [Markdown report (ordered by date)](report/report-by-date.md)

For fun, and maybe to create an IntelliJ plugin that shows alerts when your favorite stuff (SDK, databases, libraries, etc.) can receive updates. Wait and see!
